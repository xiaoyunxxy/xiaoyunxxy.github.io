# About Me
I’m a final-year PhD student in the **[Digital Security](https://dis.cs.ru.nl/)** group at **[Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/)**, where I’m fortunate to be advised by **[Stjepan Picek](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/picek-s)**. 

Before that, I earned my MSc in Advanced Computing from the **[University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/)** and a BEng in Software Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. I also spent two years as a Research Assistant at ISCAS before starting my PhD.


**Research Interests:**

My research interests lie primarily in adversarial machine learning and designing robust and general defenses against risks in machine learning technologies.
